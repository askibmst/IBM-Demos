# A Day in the Life of a Data Scientist
A Healthcare data scientist can better predict the likelihood of a patient being readmitted to the hospital and use this insight to improve quality of care, reduce medical costs and avoid costly readmission penalties.

## Business Value
As of 2011, there was over $41 Billion in additional Healthcare costs due to readmissions.  Medicare has begun instituting penalties against hospitals in order to lower the readmissions rate for their populations. The Watson Data Platform can empower any health care profession with the information and insight to both predict and prevent future admissions, improving the patient’s quality of care, avoiding unnecessary fines and reducing the billions of additional healthcare costs incurred in the healthcare industry today.

## Use Case Overview
Thirty day hospital readmissions is a huge – and costly – problem for healthcare providers.  Here, we show the steps a Data Scientist would use to develop a predictive model quickly and easily using the IBM Data Science Experience. Harnessing over a decade of hospital data, we find the combination of factors that impact whether a diabetic patient will be readmitted within 30 days of discharge and talk about how this insight can be used to predict and prevent future incidents of readmission.

## Demo Highlights
