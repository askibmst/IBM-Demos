# Finding Inefficiencies in Airbnb Markets
Data Scientists can model the price of Airbnbs in a geographic market to identify inefficiencies, thereby maximizing profits for property owners and minimizing costs for renters.

## Business Value
Carefully modelling prices of Airbnbs allows renters to select good deals and avoid overpriced listings, putting more money in their pocket.  The same model also allows property owners to intelligently price their property so that it is neither priced too high or too low, maximizing their profits.  This is an example of applied, practical machine learning for business.

## Use Case Overview
As an Airbnb renter it’s hard to know when you are getting a good deal.  Additionally, how should you best price your property when you list it with Airbnb?  How can data science help us solve these problems?  In this demonstration we use data from real Airbnbs in Portland, OR to model the effect of location and property size on final listing price.  We deploy the model into an ‘Airbnb Explorer’ app that allows renters to find better values and property owners to accurately price their assets.  Finally, we add a cognitive element by sending the reviews of each listing to Watson APIs, extracting the top keywords to get a snapshot of what staying there might be like.

## Demo Highlights
The entire project was done inside Data Science Experience – the data was gathered from the community, prepared using Jupyter, the model deployed with Watson Machine Learning, and the app built using RStudio.  The demo shows how DSX supports an end to end data science workflow.
