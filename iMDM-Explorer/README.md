# iMDM Explorer
A Financial Services Representative can access the Single View of his customers directly on a mobile device and in real time, integrating it with mobile device capabilities (maps, phone calls, SMS), increasing his effectiveness in locating customers, contacting and visiting them, and selling the best financial products based on customer’s profile and contact history.

## Business Value
MDM Server provides business value to large companies, creating the “Single View” of the customer from multiple business lines and channel. But sometimes this business value is not fully exploited, because the “Single View of the Customer” should not only be built and maintained, but also consumed by users. iMDM Explorer make available the Single View of the Customers directly on mobile devices, integrating it with the typical mobile applications (maps, phone calls)

## Use Case Overview
A Financial Services Group invested on IBM InfoSphere MDM Server solution, in order to create the Single View of the Customer from the data coming from multiple siloed applications. Last years they bridged to Cloud the MDM system. Now they need to extend the utilization of information stored into MDM system, providing to Sales Representative a mobile app directly connected to MDM. This app merges the features of MDM (the single view of the customer) with the typical features available on mobile devices: tapping on the address displayed, a Maps screen appears for locating the address and tapping on a phone number, the call can be started.

## Demo Highlights
The demo covers the typical MDM Server exploration path: search for a Customer, select the customer from a list, look at Single View of the Customer, edit and save customer’s information. When looking at customer information, it is possible to locate an address on a map just tapping on it and start a phone call or sending a SMS just tapping on the phone number.
