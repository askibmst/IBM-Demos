# Phantom Drone
An Oil & Gas company can capture pipe images and maintenance data to cognitively identify costly areas and further analyze the data to create actions to prevent future damages to certain pipes - resulting in reduced maintenance costs and labor, and increase in efficiency and safety.

## Business Value
Seamlessly show how to capture pipeline image data and analyze it instantly with our cognitive solutions.  Analyze the data over time to create new insights to decrease maintenance costs, manual effort and increase worker safety and efficiency.

## Use Case Overview
Oil & Gas companies have tons of manned inspections that can take weeks to perform, can expose workers to dangerous environments, and can cost the company a lot of money since the human resources need to be maintained throughout that entire time. With a drone, companies will be able to save a lot of time since a drone is able to inspect oil pipelines in less time and is more efficient. Drones constantly monitoring oil pipelines would allow them to collect data on what the “normal” conditions are (pipelines in good condition) and once a “negative” condition (visuals with possible oil leaks) has been detected, it can automatically notify the right person to address the issue immediately. Overall, this would mean less time wasted, less cost for labor, high efficiency and increased safety.
