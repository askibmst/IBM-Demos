# Cognitive Technical Assistant
Engineers, Operators and Service Technicians now have a Cognitive Assistant that can crawl vast document repositories to quickly extract key information and insights needed to improve the efficiency and quality of their responses, saving time and money.

## Business Value
Engineering information such as drawings, specifications, test results, operation procedures, repair procedures, videos, safety procedures, maintenance logs, incident reports, etc., are ingested, analyzed, and mined to provide a smart way to search and gather insights. The results are more than just a set of records, but information that is contextualized, correlated and inferred, that provides insights for making well-informed decisions.

## Use Case Overview
Manufacturing companies generate tremendous amount of documents throughout the design, construction, operation, and repair phases of their processes. These are a crucial source of knowledge for employees who spend much of their time every day searching for relevant information. The documents are often siloed in different systems, difficult to search, lack relevance, and take significant efforts to manage. Another concern is that over the years, companies lose the tribal knowledge from employees with many years of experience.  Cognitive Technical Assistant crawls document repositories to extract key information and can also be trained by experts in the field to capture key experiential data. The system can provide responses to queries within seconds, greatly improving the efficiency and quality of responses.
