# Watson Unified Search
Data Scientists and App Developers can collaborate seamlessly to utilize customer insight in real-time, and create cognitive applications that provide personalized user experiences – and meet the demands of Marketing to increase conversion/drive revenue.

## Business Value
Augment customer profile data with social media data, in-app behavior and geographic location (in real-time), to allow for a guided search experience and personalized event promotions –  engaging the end user to spend more time in the mobile app – ultimately leading to an increase in customer satisfaction and ticket conversion rate $$.

## Use Case Overview
With customer data being collected every second – from multiple sources, it can be challenging to grasp and put to work in a way that positively impacts the user experience. The ability to do this in real-time is critical. Watson Unified Search simplifies the process for collecting information on the end user (Who are they? What do they like? Where are they in relation to nearby events?), and incorporating machine learning/natural language understanding to power a cognitive application which displays personalized event promotions.
