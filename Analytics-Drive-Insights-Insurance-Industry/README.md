# Analytics Drive Insights – Insurance Industry
Business Analysts and Data Scientists are having a difficult time collaborating together as they work on completely separate platforms, and the data across the organization is siloed. This is affecting the bottom line because they are unable to effectively rate customer risk level when it comes to changing or creating existing and new car insurance coverage.

## Business Value
Business Analysts and Data Scientists are able to work together to drive insights.  These personas provide actionable insights based on the results they find, purely based on the vehicle collision data and driving records.  Those actionable insights are visual and can guide users to quickly and intuitively identify collision patterns and predict the future.  These solutions are easy to use, flexible, collaborative and smart.

## Use Case Overview
This demo shows how Business Analysts and Data Scientists, in a car insurance company, can collaborate with one another.  In the meanwhile, making sure that the data source is trusted and consistent.  By analyzing vehicle collision data, we are able to know what accidents happened in the past two years in NYC.  In addition, a prediction model is built.  By revealing factors that can affect a car accident, we are able to provide useful advice for insurance companies. This will allow insurance companies to better evaluate their customer and decrease costs.
