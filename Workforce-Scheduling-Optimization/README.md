# Workforce Scheduling â€“ Optimization
(Hospital) Administrators and Planners can quickly build efficient weekly workforce schedules to optimize cost while balancing service levels, also resulting in workforce satisfaction.

## Business Value
Build optimal and cost effective, valid schedules within seconds while also comparing various scenarios to pick a final solution.  Be able to balance conflicting objectives, constraints and preferences, as well as obtain final cost numbers within seconds.  Be able to reschedule quickly due to unforeseen conditions or new information.

## Use Case Overview
Hospital administration can utilize the power of mathematical optimization through this solution to quickly and effectively assign resources to shifts to meet demand while trying to balance multiple objectives, business rules and preferences of employees and administration.  It not only speeds up the planning process, but also provides an optimal solution which probably could not be found by manual effort.  Such automation can allow the planners to take more constraints and employee preferences into account which can result in increased employee satisfaction and improved service levels. In this demo, 32 nurses with different levels of seniority, qualification, pay rate, availability and skill set are optimally assigned to 36 shifts for the week between the Emergency and Consultation department.  Each shift/department has minimum requirement for headcount and skill set, while the solution also allows configuring of high level business rules.

## Demo Highlights
