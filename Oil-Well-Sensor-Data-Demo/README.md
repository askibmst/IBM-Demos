# Oil Well Sensor Data WA Demo
An Analyst uses IoT data from oil well sensors, then uses Watson Analytics to generate actionable insights that can indicate and prevent potential issues with the oil wells that could disrupt the flow of oil and drive the organization’s bottom line.

## Business Value
This demo shows how smarter self-service using WA can turn IoT data into actionable insights. When an analyst must extract Sensor data from sensors in oil wells to understand the signals that could stop the production of oil by reducing downtime, managing costs, and improving efficiencies.

## Use Case Overview
Focusing on the Industrial Market, an analyst must extract Sensor data from sensors in oil wells to understand potential signals that could stop the production of oil. The Analyst uses IoT data streamed into a dataset, then uses Watson Analytics to generate insights that indicate potential issues with the oil wells that could disrupt the flow of oil.  The organization uses the insights to dispatch preventative maintenance teams when needed.

## Demo Highlights
This demo walks through a Watson Analytics solution that business users, Analysts, and Data Scientists can use WA to easily turn IoT data from oil wells into actionable insights to help prevent downtime and improve maintenance costs that can improve the bottom line metrics.
