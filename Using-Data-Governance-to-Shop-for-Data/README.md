# Using Data Governance to Shop for Data
Business Analysts can use a governance catalog to find data and assess its quality.  They can then create custom extracts and use the power of Cognitive Analytics to quickly derive new actionable insights from the data.

## Business Value
Reduce the amount of time analysts spend hunting for data and preparing data for analysis.  Reduce the number of calls to IT from analysts needing custom extracts and custom reports by implementing self-service.  Analysts will be able to deliver actionable insights more quickly and more reliably.

## Use Case Overview
This demo is targeted at Line of Business (LOB) Business Analysts and Data Scientists who have difficulty finding the data necessary to do performance data analysis. Once they find the data they need, these users prefer to create their own customized dataset in a personal “sandbox” to work on. These Business Analysts also frequently need to perform quick visual analysis on new data, but are handicapped by existing visualization tools which often need extensive setup, customization, and training to use.

## Demo Highlights
This demo shows how an analyst uses data governance to find the data they need.  It then shifts to Bluemix Data Connect to demonstrate how that analyst would then create a customized extract to work with.  Data Connect sends the output to Watson Analytics, and shows how quickly data can be analyzed via cognitive and predictive visualizations.
